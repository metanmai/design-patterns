## Introduction

The Singleton Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance while providing a global point of access to that instance. It restricts the instantiation of a class to a single object and provides a way to access that instance from any point in the application.

## Intent

The main intent of the Singleton Design Pattern is to:

- Ensure that a class has only one instance and provide a way to access it.
- Provide a global point of access to the instance.

## Problem Statement

In many situations, there is a need to have a single point of control or coordination, such as a configuration manager, logging service, or database connection pool. Creating multiple instances of such objects can lead to inefficiency or incorrect behavior.

## Solution

The Singleton Design Pattern solves this problem by defining a class that has only one instance and providing a mechanism to access that instance. It typically involves creating a private constructor and a static method to access the instance. The first time the instance is requested, it is created; subsequent requests return the existing instance.

## Structure

The key components of the Singleton Design Pattern are:

1. **Singleton:** This is the class that ensures only one instance is created and provides a method for accessing that instance.

## Use Cases

- When you need to control access to a shared resource, such as a configuration object or a database connection.
- When a single point of control or coordination is required in the application.

## Pros and Cons

### Pros:

1. Ensures a single instance of the class exists throughout the application.
2. Provides a global point of access to the instance.
3. Lazy initialization can be used to create the instance only when it's needed.

### Cons:

1. May introduce global state, which can make the code less testable and maintainable.
2. Can hinder parallelism if not properly designed for multithreading.

## Related Patterns

- **Factory Method Pattern:** Singleton is often implemented using the Factory Method pattern to control the instantiation of the single instance.
